# Interview Responses

## 1. How would you create/maintain an engaging environment for your team?
To create an engaging environment, I focus on three pillars: open and transparent communication, recognition and development of individual skills, and fostering a climate of respect and collaboration. I regularly organize team meetings to discuss projects and challenges, encourage open feedback, and value the contribution of each team member.

## 2. Give an example of a situation in which as a leader you failed and explain how you could have handled it differently.
In the past, I underestimated the importance of clearly communicating project objectives to all team members, leading to confusion and delays. I should have invested more time in initial planning and ensuring everyone had a clear understanding of expectations and roles.

## 3. How would you go about creating cohesion in a team that is not of one mind?
I would start by understanding the different perspectives and concerns of team members, facilitating open dialogue to find common ground. I would organize team-building activities to strengthen bonds and encourage the sharing of common goals. Additionally, I would establish clear processes and defined responsibilities to improve transparency and collaboration.

## 4. How do you build support for ideas/goals with people who do not report to you, and you have no authority over them?
To gain support from colleagues and external stakeholders, I focus on building relationships based on trust and credibility. I present my ideas clearly, highlighting the benefits, and actively listen to their concerns. I seek common ground and am open to adjustments based on received feedback.

## 5. Name a time when an employee disagreed with your directive and how you handled it.
In a similar situation, I encountered resistance from a team member on a key project decision. I arranged a private discussion to understand their concerns and clarified the rationale behind the decision. After carefully listening to their opinions, we reached a compromise that addressed their concerns without compromising the project's main objectives.

## 6. How do you achieve objectives in a fast-paced environment?
To achieve objectives in a fast-paced environment, I rely on detailed planning and prioritization of tasks. I am accustomed to managing tight deadlines by breaking tasks into manageable stages, setting clear milestones, and continuously monitoring progress. Effective communication with the team is essential to adapt quickly to changes and address issues promptly.

## 7. What is the most significant change that you brought to an organization?
I led the implementation of a new CRM back-office system for a major Investment Bank, significantly improving transparency and operational efficiency, and achieving satisfaction from the demand manager and other stakeholders. I also focused on strengthening approval workflows and various departmental processes. This change streamlined collaboration across departments, reducing response times, and enhancing the quality of outcomes.
